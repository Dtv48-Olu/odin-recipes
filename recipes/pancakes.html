        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Making pancakes is a breeze! Just whisk together your dry ingredients like flour, sugar, and baking powder. In a separate bowl, combine the wet ingredients like milk, egg, and melted butter. Gently mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined - a few lumps are okay! Then, heat a lightly oiled pan over medium heat and pour in your batter, a Â¼ cup at a time. Let the pancakes cook until bubbles appear on the surface and the edges look dry. Flip and cook for another minute or two, until golden brown. Once done, stack those beauties high and drizzle with your favorite syrup for a delicious breakfast!</p>
