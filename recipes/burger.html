        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Who doesn't love a good burger? Start with a juicy beef patty,
            cooked to perfection. Add your favorite cheese, like cheddar or
            Swiss, and melt it over the patty while it's still hot. Place the
            patty on a toasted bun and top with fresh lettuce, tomato, and any
            other toppings you desire. Don't forget the condiments - ketchup,
            mustard, and mayo are classic choices. Serve with a side of crispy
            fries or a fresh salad for a delicious meal!

            </li>
            <li>
                While the patty is still hot, add a slice of your favorite
                cheese on top to melt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Toast the burger bun until golden brown and assemble your burger
